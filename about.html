<h5>Hi, my name is Hilal Alsibai</h5>

<p>
I'm a software engineer, gamer, wanna-be artist and music hipster. I have lived in California, USA for the majority of my life and I currently reside in the San Francisco Bay Area, writing code for <a href="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</a> as a software engineer.

<p>
My primary passions are within interactive type media as well as low level "raw" type algorithmic problems. In my past I have considerably dabbled with web development and game development to the point where it is sort of my self-fulfillment side job.
