<h5>Hi, my name is Hilal (Hil) Alsibai</h5>
<img src="/assets/img/me.jpg" id="about-me"/>
<p>
I currently reside in the San Francisco Bay Area, writing various code for <a href="https://www.meta.com/">Meta</a> as a software engineer. 
</p>
<p>
My primary passions are within interactive type media as well as low level "raw" type algorithmic problems. In my past I have considerably dabbled with web development and game development to the point where it is sort of my self-fulfillment side job.

<p>
This blog will contain articles for things that I consider interesting to write about, which admittedly is not a lot :)
